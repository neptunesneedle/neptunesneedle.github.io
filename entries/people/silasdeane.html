yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Diplomat and politician.

p2: With his attendance at the Continental Congress in the summer of 1774 a new stage of Deane's career opened. In the first congress as well as its successor in 1775, he quickly affiliated himself with like-minded men of commerce, most especially those from the middle colonies. No one doubted his patriotism or his keen eye for mercantile connections as he served on committees concerned with arming the Continental army and provisioning a nascent navy.
