yourname: Peter Richards

p1: ... He early took to sea and at twenty went a-whaling to the St. Lawrence. His adventurous spirit led him into the French and Indian War, but after one campaign he returned to the sea and entered the coasting trade. ... During the Revolutionary War he commanded privateers; in 1777, the Fanny; in 1778, the Count D’Estaing; and in 1780, the Marianne. He was a pioneer of the maritime fur trade, commanding the expedition of the Columbia and the Washington (or Lady Washington) which left Boston in September 1787 and arrived at Nootka a year later. There his diplomatic skill saved his vessel from seizure by the Spaniards. 

p2: In July 1789 he transferred the Columbia to his associate, Capt. Robert Gray, and traded in the little sloop, Washington, along the coast from Nootka to Queen Charlotte Islands. In the autumn of 1789 he sailed for China, by way of the Hawaiian Islands, and while there had a vision of opening a trade in pearls and sandalwood. For that purpose he left three men to collect these commodities, but the effort proved a failure as the men tired of the task.

p3: Arriving in China Kendrick spent fourteen months in disposing of his cargo and in rerigging the Washington as a brig. In March 1791 he sailed thence for the Northwest Coast. On his way he visited Japan, the first to fly the stars and stripes in Nippon, but the country offered no market for sea-otter skins. At Queen Charlotte Islands, then a fur trader’s paradise, the Indians attempted to capture the Washington. Kendrick’s courage enheartened his crew who drove the assailants off with heavy loss. During this voyage he purchased large areas of land from the natives of Vancouver Island, but the speculation was a complete failure. In the spring of 1793 he sailed again from China and traded on the Northwest Coast in the seasons of 1793 and 1794. Late in 1794 on his route to China, he revisited the Hawaiian Islands and took part in an inter-island war. Killed in a freak accident afterwards.
