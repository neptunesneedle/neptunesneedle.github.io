p1: Merchant and politician. In 1745 young John was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, Thomas and Lydia Hancock, in Boston. Thomas Hancock was one of the town's wealthiest merchants.

p2: In the summer of 1761 Hancock found his uncle in ill health and anxious to have his nephew take greater responsibility for the business. Hancock quickly immersed himself in exporting whale oil, loaning money, buying and selling real estate, negotiating government contracts, and general merchandising.

p3: On 1 August 1764 Thomas Hancock died. John Hancock took charge of the business at an ill moment. Saddled by the long war with an enormous debt, the British government was desperate for new revenue sources and sought them in the American colonies. As a businessman Hancock resented the actions of the king and Parliament. Their blundering attempts at raising revenue in the colonies through the Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 proved disastrous for his business. At the same time, as an American and a key political leader in Boston, Hancock resented what he and others saw as an abridgement of their rights as Englishmen.

p4: Hancock's image as a patriot leader was further enhanced in May 1768 when customs officers seized his sloop Liberty on charges of smuggling Madeira wine. That Hancock was guilty was less important than that the local Whig propaganda machine could turn this event into yet another example of dreadful British tyranny. With the help of the Sons of Liberty the mob was aroused, and the customs officers were forced to flee for their lives. At the same time Hancock was portrayed as a victim of oppression and a martyr to the patriot cause.

p5: Hancock left Boston early in the spring of 1775 and took up residence in Lexington at the same parsonage where he had once lived with his grandfather. He was there with Samuel Adams on 18 April when Paul Revere arrived to warn them of the approach of British troops. Hancock and Adams escaped, and within a few days of the events at Lexington and Concord they were en route to Philadelphia to attend the Continental Congress.

p6: Elected president of the Congress. Hancock's presidency lasted more than two years. His authority was limited to that of a presiding officer. Most of the work of the Congress was accomplished through numerous committees, creating a confusing patchwork of enormous inefficiencies. Hancock's greatest moment came on 4 July 1776 when with characteristic flair he was the first person to sign the Declaration of Independence. Served as Governor of Massachusetts. He died in Boston.
