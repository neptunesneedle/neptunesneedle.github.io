yourname: Peter Richards

p1: The son of the Viking explorer Eric the Red, variously located in Norway and Iceland, until discovering Greenland in late 990s. Around 1000 AD Ericsson likely sailed down the North American coast, possibly reaching as far south as Nova Scotia, which he called Vinland. He then returned to Greenland. His travels reported in the Saga of the Greenlanders and, of dubious authenticity, the "Vineland Map"
