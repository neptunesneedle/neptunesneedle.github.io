p1: In 1837, Bancroft was appointed collector of the port of Boston. Polk's victory in the 1844 Presidential election brought Bancroft to Washington, D.C., where he joined the cabinet as secretary of the navy. As secretary Bancroft acquired first-hand experience at conducting foreign policy in a democratic society. He also helped found the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis and tried to streamline the Navy Department. Bancroft was instrumental in the acquisition of California, ordering the Pacific Naval Squadron in June 1845 to occupy San Francisco and other ports in case of war.
