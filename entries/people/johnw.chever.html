yourname: Peter Richards

p1: ...went to sea at thirteen as cabin boy on the America. By 1810, he was mate of the Fame and at nineteen, he was given command of the ship Belisarius. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, the Crowninshields converted their crack ship America into a privateer, mounting twenty guns, manned by a crew of 150, and cut down so that she was probably the fastest ship afloat. On her first two cruises, Chever served as prize master and lieutenant under Captains Joseph Ropes and John Kehew, respectively. Late in 1813, he was made captain of the ship, at twenty-two. He cruised between the English Channel and the Canary Islands, able to outsail any of the British frigates. On this third cruise of the ship she captured twelve prizes, three of which were burned and a fourth used as a target. The fourth cruise lasted only six days, as she struck a derelict and had to return to port. The final cruise carried her again to European waters under Chever's command, netted thirteen prizes, and involved a sharp and victorious fight with a well-armed English packet. In less than three years, the America had sent in prizes worth $1,100,000, half of which went to the owners and the rest to officers and crew. For success, this record was approached only by the Grand Turk of Salem, and for boldness, by Capt. Thomas Boyle of Baltimore in the Chasseur. ...he continued for many years in command of Salem ships, later retiring as wharfinger at Salem, where he died.
