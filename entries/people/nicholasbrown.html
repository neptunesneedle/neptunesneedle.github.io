yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Providence-born merchant, who, along with his brothers John, Joseph and Moses, built the largest maritime commercial house in colonial Rhode Island, Nicholas Brown and Company. Among other pursuits, the company engaged in the slave trade, sponsoring a 1764-65 to West Africa during which 106 of the 191 forcibly procured slaves died before reaching the intended West Indies market. This was one of perhaps a thousand such voyages by Rhode Island ships during the four decades on either side of the Revolution.
