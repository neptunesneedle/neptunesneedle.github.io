yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Author, lawyer and defender of seaman's rights. Dana was born in 1815, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of a lawyer-essayist into a family that traced its Massachusetts origins to 1650. Richard Henry Jr., entered Harvard in 1831, the fourth generation of Danas to do so. After two years of study, interrupted by his participation in a student rebellion in 1832 (for which he was rusticated), he began to experience difficulties with his sight. Droppping out of college but with insufficient funds to finance a European tour, he decided to go to sea as an ordinary seaman. In August 1834 he set out from Boston on the brig Pilgrim for what was scheduled to be a two-year voayage to California and back.

p2: Dana's stuggles learning his way as a sailor are decsribed by him in his personal narrative, Two Years before the Mast , which he published in 1840. His entire voyage consisted of six months at sea, during which the Pilgrim managed to get around Cape Horn and up to California, and during which the ship's captain gave ample evidence of his brutality in dealing with the crew, 16 months collecting and processing leather skins up and down the California coast between San Francisco and San Diego, including considerable stretches ashore where Dana lived in a tent that he shared with a native girl. After a change in plans whereby the Pilgrim was now going to stay in California for an additional two years, Dana wrangled a billet on the Alert, a much better managed ship, on which he departed California in May 1836, returning to Boston in Septemebr. 

p3: He thereupon reenterd Harvard to graduate a member of the Class of 1837 (Henry David Thoreau was another member). 

p4: In 1840 he completed his legal apprenticeship and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar. That same year Two Years before the Mast was published by Harper & Brothers. Although it was a popular success both in the United States and Britain, Dana's contract secured him only $250 of the the $10,000 his American publisher made from the book in its first two years. His English publishers were more generous, although it was not until 1869, when the original copyright lapsed, that Dana received a decent share of the profits from the book's continuing sales. 

p5: In 1841, Dana published The Seaman's Friend , a manual for sailors (including a dictionary of nautical terms) and a plea that society accord sailors their basic rights as Americans and laborers. His commitment to sailors rights continued to be demonstrated throughout his 30-year legal career by the frequency with which he defended sailors against overbearing and dishonest shipowners.

p6: In the late 1840s he became active in the anti-slavery movement, being one of the founders of the Free Soil party in Massachusetts. he later became a Republican, a Civil War appointee of President Lincoln as federal attorney in Massachusetts. After the war his legal business tapered off until in 1878 he departed Boston for Europe, ostensibly to do research on a book on international law. He died in Rome in 1882.

p7: Two Years Before the Mast remained/s a popular book, both among young readers and as a truthful and unromanticized account of the seaman's lot at sea in the age of sail. He wrote it explicitly to contrast with James Fenimore Cooper's two decidedly more romantic accounts of life at sea, the novels The Pilot (1824) and Red Rover (1827). Herman Melville later acknowledged Dana's impact on him, not least convincing him of the literary possibilities of an extended stint at sea as a working sailor. In 1923 The novelist and critic D. H. Lawrence, in his Studies in Classic American Literature, declared Two Years before the Mast "a great book."
