yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Rear admiral in the U.S. Navy.

p2: In 1841 Luce was appointed a midshipman. After six months of training he joined the frigate Congress on duty in the Mediterranean and then in South American waters. Returning to New York in 1845, Luce was stationed on the 74-gun ship of the line Columbus. The Columbus sailed for the Far East, where it was based until being called home upon the outbreak of the war with Mexico.

p3: After the war Luce attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, which had opened in 1845. Luce graduated in 1849. In May 1853 Luce joined the steamer Vixen and served briefly with the Home Squadron in Pensacola. He then received orders to the U.S. Coast Survey for a three-year tour of duty.

p4: Luce served from 1857 to 1860 in the sloop of war Jamestown with the Home Squadron in the West Indies and off the coast of Central America. In May 1860 he reported to Annapolis, where he accepted an assignment as instructor in seamanship and gunnery. This shore duty allowed Luce his first opportunity to write for publication.

p5: In the summer of 1863 Luce received his first command, the academy practice ship Macedonian, In June 1865 he returned to the Naval Academy as a commandant of midshipmen. In September 1868 Luce returned to sea duty and remained in this capacity until September 1872, when he became equipment officer of the Boston Navy Yard, moving up to captain of the yard shortly after his promotion to captain. Luce became increasingly interested in naval training.

p6: After working to secure the permanent acquisition of Coaster's Harbor Island for the navy, Luce worked to establish a school for the advanced education of naval officers in the highest aspects of their profession; diplomacy, strategy, tactics, international law, and logistics. In March 1884 he approached Secretary of the Navy William Chandler, who appointed Luce to head a board to consider the proposal. Chandler formally approved the establishment of the Naval War College in October 1884, appointing Luce its first president. The college opened a year later for a month-long series of lectures.

p7: In June 1886 Luce left the Naval War College to resume command of the North Atlantic Squadron. While in this capacity he became involved in the Canadian-American fisheries dispute, a complex issue involving party politics in Congress as well as foreign relations. While he was serving as the senior officer in the navy, Luce was the president of the Naval Institute from 1887 to 1889. He retired from active duty on 1 February 1889.

p8: Settling in Newport, Rhode Island, Luce remained active in the life of the Naval War College, frequently lecturing and writing. Luce died at his home in Newport.
