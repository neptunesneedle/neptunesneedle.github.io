At outbreak of World War II, Halsey was promoted to vice admiral in command of the Aircraft Battle Force and Carrier Division Two. On board the Enterprise in 1941, he placed his command on a war footing. When Pearl Harbor wass attacked, his forces were at sea and escaped damage. In 1942 his two-carrier task force raided the japanese-held Marshall, Gilbert, Wake and marcus islands, giving a valuable boost to public morale and earning Halsey a worldwide reputation. In April of 1942, Halsey commanded the carriers Hornet and Enterprise as a secret base for James Doolittle's raids on the Japanese mainland. In August of that year, he commanded the South Pacific Force, winning the key naval battles of Santa Cruz and Guadalcanal. Promoted to full admiral in November 1942. As commander in the South Pacific theater, Halsey successfully secured that area through the campaigns for the Solomon Islands. he became commander of the Third Fleet in 1944. His units provided strategic support MacArthur's landing in the Philippines. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf 9Oct. 1944) Halsey was successfully tricked by a Japanese decoy, which diverted Halsey's forces away from the main battle. Halsey's actions became more controversial when he led the Third Fleet into a diastrous typhoon in December of 1944 and again in June of 1945. The Japanese surrendered on board his flagship Missouri in 1945. Retired in 1947 with the rank of fleet admiral.
