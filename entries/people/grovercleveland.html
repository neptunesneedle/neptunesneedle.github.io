yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Twenty-second and twenty-fourth president of the United States.

p2: Cleveland was the first Democrat to occupy the White House since James Buchanan left office in 1861. William C. Whitney was his secretary of the navy. A priority in his administration was correction of the mismanagement in the Navy Department, to which Congress had assigned the task of building a modern, steel-plated navy during the preceding Chester A. Arthur administration. Cleveland's support of this goal in his first and second administrations was critical to the American naval victory in the Spanish-American War.

p3: The president turned down river and harbor appropriations. Cleveland surprised the country midway in his first term by launching a frontal attack on the tariff. Cleveland warned that "unnecessary taxation" imposed by existing customs duties were a "peril" to the nation.
