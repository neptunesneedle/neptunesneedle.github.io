p1: Shipbuilder. Hall served his apprenticeship in the shipyard of Deacon Elijah Barstow in Hanover and built several vessels in the Hanover-Marshfield area in the years 1825-1827. The Waverly, a 230-ton brig, was the last ship Hall built in Marshfield. When he achieved his majority, Hall left Barstow's yard.

p2: Hall first settled in Medford, Massachusetts, to work in the shipyards on the Mystic River, then a center for the construction of wooden ships. From there he went up to the Penobscot River, near Camden, Maine, where he worked as a shipwright and ship's carpenter. Hall had a habit of getting the wood for a ship himself and was known to lead gangs of men into the woods of eastern Maine to search for ship frames. In 1837 Hall moved to Duxbury, Massachusetts. He worked as a shipwright in the yards of Ezra Weston, the premier shipbuilder on Cape Cod. Hall then built for a time on his own in Duxbury. In 1839 he moved to East Boston, then an island in Boston harbor, where William H. Sumner and the East Boston Company were attempting to establish shipbuilding as a commercial enterprise. Hall, the first shipbuilder to move to the island, set up his shipyard at the foot of Maverick Street.

p3: Hall's first East Boston ship, the Akbar, was built for Boston merchant R. B. Forbes and was used in the China trade. The 650-ton Akbar was an unusually fast ship; Hall is believed to have modeled it after a schooner of the Baltimore clipper type. In 1842 Hall launched the schooner Zephyr and in 1843 the brig Antelope, both for Forbes. Hall built twenty-eight small ships at his Maverick Street yard between 1840 and 1850. In 1850 he launched the Surprise, the first clipper ship to be built in Massachusetts and the vessel that made his name. The Surprise had a long, sharp bow, considered best for speed, with a full, powerful afterbody. Before the clipper ship, designers had to choose between carrying capacity and speed. With the launch of the Surprise, Hall was one of the first designers to show that this choice was not an absolute. A fast and profitable ship, the Surprise sailed for twenty-five years, until destroyed by a drunken pilot off the coast of Japan. For a time Hall was the most eminent shipbuilder in Massachusetts.

p4: Over the next five years, Hall constructed a number of clipper ships, whose excellence was surpassed only--and not always--by those ships built at the nearby East Boston yard of his friend Donald McKay. In 1852 the John Gilpin raced McKay's Flying Fish from New York to San Francisco, losing by a day. Hall built most of his ships for the large merchant fleets owned by wealthy Boston families, such as the Bacons and the Forbeses, and occasionally for the concern of Pierce & Hunnewell.

p5: Hall was a master shipbuilder, a visionary in some respects, but he was not a naval architect. Unlike McKay, who designed all his own ships, Hall had the plans of several of his large ships, including the Game Cock and the Surprise, drawn up by Samuel Hartt Pook, the first independent naval architect in New England. Even so, Hall, who had a national reputation, was the equal of the greatest shipbuilders of his time. In all, 110 ships were launched from Hall's East Boston shipyard.
