p1: Merchant and yachtsman. The Crowninshields, among the richest Salem merchant families, gained their wealth through privateering and in the Far Eastern trade for which Salem was famed in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. After studying navigation and going to sea as a captain's clerk, Crowninshield commanded a ship to the West Indies in 1790 and, according to records, commanded the Belisarius to the East Indies four years later. Crowninshield's work was largely in the outfitting of ships and rescuing people from ships in distress, for the purpose of which he maintained a vessel, was a passion. 

p2: In 1813 the American Chesapeake was defeated off Marblehead by HMS Shannon. Captain James Lawrence (of "don't give up the ship" fame) and a Lieutenant Ludlow were killed in the action, and their bodies were buried by the British in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Crowninshield captained the family ship that brought their bodies back for a ceremonious reburial in Salem and final interment in New York. Though the idea had not been his and the costs were shared by prominent Salemites, he was lavishly praised for the deed.

p3: Crowninshield gained a measure of national and international fame (or notoriety) with his Cleopatra's Barge, the first American vessel built solely as a pleasure yacht. Launched in 1816, this barkentine was 83 feet long at the waterline and 23 feet in beam and was built for speed. The elaborately painted and gilded vessel boasted a sumptuous interior. Its $50,000 cost of construction was probably matched by the expense of equipping and provisioning; everything about it was calculated to awe and impress. 

p4: Setting sail from Salem on 30 March 1817 with fourteen men and 300 letters of recommendation from prominent Americans, the yacht touched at the Azores and went on to Gibraltar, where Crowninshield hoped to receive the Princess of Wales aboard. That was the first of a series of disappointments; though Cleopatra's Bargeattracted huge crowds of sensation-seekers at various ports around the Mediterranean, Crowninshield was unable to attract the royalty he had envisioned entertaining. The diary kept by his cynical cousin, "Philosopher Ben" Crowninshield, refers to the throngs of curiosity seekers as "canaille." It records scenes of crowded disorder, drunkenness, seasickness, and uproar. 

p5: By 3 October 1817 Cleopatra's Barge had returned to Salem, and two months later Crowninshield died there of a heart attack.
