yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Thirty-sixth president of the United States.

p2: When it appeared that the United States might become involved in the Second World War, Johnson obtained a commission in the navy reserves. A few days after Pearl Harbor, he wrote Roosevelt, asking to be assigned to active duty. He was commissioned a lieutenant commander and sent to the Pacific on a presidential fact-finding mission to investigate conditions at General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters. Johnson's active duty tour lasted only a few months and included only one combat experience, when he tagged along on a bombing raid over Japanese-held territory. The mission came under heavy fire, and Johnson was awarded a Silver Star for bravery.
