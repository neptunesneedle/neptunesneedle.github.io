p1: Sailing from Boston, September 1787, in the sloop Lady Washington, with the Columbia, under Captain John Kendrick, Gray made the northwest coast, succeeded to command of the Columbia, gathered a cargo of sea-otter skins, and returned home by way of China, arriving at Boston in August 1790. He had sailed almost 42,000 miles and had carried the American flag around the world for the first time. After a refit, the Columbia sailed again in September 1790, arriving at Vancouver Island in June 1791. In the spring of 1792, Gray sailed his ship through the difficult passage at the mouth of the Columbia River and made an effectual discovery of that river; this later served as foundation of the U.S. claim to Oregon.
