p1: Lecturer and author.

p2: Emerson's first book, Nature (1836), was a rallying cry for the Transcendentalists, espousing organicism in art and viewing Nature as the divine teacher of man. The publication of Nature came when many new ideas were formed abroad; it was Emerson, though, who brought most of these concepts together in one place and produced the closest thing that the Transcendentalists had to a manifesto. Although the book was published anonymously, Emerson was widely known to be its author, and he became the central figure among the Transcendentalists.
