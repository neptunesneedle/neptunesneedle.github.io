yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Scottish-trained marine scientist at the University of Edinburgh, who, in 1841, hypothesized on the basis of some deep water samplings, that no life existed below 300 fathoms (900'). Efforts to confirm and challenge his "azoic zone" theory [no life] led to a surge in mid-19th-century oceanographic research, which rather quickly repudiated his theory.
