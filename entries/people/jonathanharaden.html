yourname: Peter Richards

p1: ... His sea service in the Revolution began in July 1776, as lieutenant on the sloop Tyrannicide, of the Massachusetts state navy, commanded by Capt. John Fisk. Two successful cruises were made during the year. In 1777 Haraden was given command of the Tyrannicide, now changed to a brigantine. He cruised about the British Isles and France in company with Captain Fisk who had been transferred to the brigantine Massachusetts. They took several prizes, including a transport with Hessian troops. They were chased by a British squadron and the Tyrannicide had a narrow escape. She returned to Boston in August, sailed again in the fall, and during the winter cruised in the West Indies. In the summer of 1778 Haraden left the state service to begin his career as a privateersman in command of the 16-gun shop General Pickering of Salem. At first he sailed with cargoes to France and Spain and return, but later, as a privateer, devoted his ship wholly to commerce destroying. He was in many actions, sometimes with vessels of superior force, and took many prizes. In October 1779, of Sandy Hook, the Pickering engaged simultaneously three letters of marque, of 14, 10, and 8 guns. After an action of an hour and a half she captured all three and took them into port. In June 1780, in the Bay of Biscay, she took a 22-gun schooner and a few days later fell in with the British privateer Achilles, a much larger ship than the Pickering and of more than three times her force. They fought nearly three hours at close range and the Achilles then sheered off and sailed away. The Pickering was unable to follow, but recaptured her prize, which had been taken by the Achilles. The battle was fought close to the Spanish coast and was watched by a multitude of people. Early in 1781 the Pickering was captured by Admiral Rodney at St. Eustatius, and Haraden was made a prisoner of war. After regaining his liberty, he commanded the 14-gun ship Julius Caesar, another Salem privateer, in which he sailed in 1782. In June he fought a British ship and brig, of 18 and 16 guns, for two and a half hours and then escaped from them.
