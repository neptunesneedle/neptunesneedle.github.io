yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Born in England and migrated to New Zealand as a young man. Involved in the interwar promotion of long distance aviation. Became a sailor in his forties. Won the first solo transatlantic race in 1960, sailing from Plymouth, England, to NYC in 40 days. In 1964 was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In 1966, aboard, the 54' ketch Gypsy Moth IV, sailed from Plymouth on August 26, on route that took him eastward around the globe in 220 sailing days, with only one stopover in Sydney. Was only the second (after Joshua Slocum, 1895-98) and much the faster circumnavigation at the time. Has since been surpassed by several other solo sailors, including some who have made the circuit non-stop.
