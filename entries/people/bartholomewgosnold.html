p1: Experienced sea captain and privateer, Gosnold was employed by Bristol merchants to transport and settle a permanent contingent of settlers on the New England coast to service the fishing fleet home ported in Bristol. Sailed in the Concord, accompanied by Gabriel Archer and John Brereton, who later described the expedition. After making landfall in Maine, Gosnold proceeded south to Cape Cod and then westward along the ocean side of the Cape to the Elizabeth Islands in Buzzards Bay. When designated settlers refused to remain ashore on Cuttyhunk Island, Gosnold loaded ship with sassafras and returned to Bristol.

p2: Gosnold was master of the Goodspeed , which, along with the Susan Constanct and Discovery , planted English settlers in Jamestown in 1607. He likely recruited Captain John Smith to become part of the undertaking. Gosnold died within weeks of their arrival.
