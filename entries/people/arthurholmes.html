yourname: Peter Richards

p1: English geophysicist who, in 1929, sought to provide Wegener's "continental drift" theory with an explanation by suggesting that the sea floor was subject to periodic rearrangements due to thermal convection. His idea received little attention until the 1950s, but later proved to lead to the plate tectonics explanations of Harry Hess,R. Deitz and others in the 1960s.
