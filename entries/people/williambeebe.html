yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Naturalist, oceanographer, and zoological society executive.

p2: Beebe gave some attention to the fish and coral reefs in the waters around Haiti in 1927.

p3: The well-publicized helmet diving done by Beebe to study fish and other marine species commenced in the Galapagos in 1925, but sustained work in the waters off Bermuda and nearby islands was not begun until 1928. A spherical diving device known as the bathysphere, financed and developed by Otis Barton, was used to make some thirty descents, the deepest being one of 3,028 feet off Nonsuch Island in 1934. This record was not exceeded for fifteen years. Later Beebe undertook more oceanographic work off the coast of Baja California in 1936 and the Pacific coast of Central America in 1937 and 1938.
