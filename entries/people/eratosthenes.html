yourname: Peter Richards

p1: A North African scholar residing in Alexandria; around 210 BC. He calculated the sun's declination at different times and locations along the north/south-running Nile River. By this method he produced a relatively accurate estimate of the circumference of the earth and devised a measurement akin to latitude.

p2: He was also a student of the Nile River and its sources. 

p3: On June 21, Eratosthenes reckoned that in Syene, which was on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun was directly overhead (90 degrees)at noontime; at Alexandria, 500 miles to the north, the noontime sun was at 82 degrees or 8 degrees on the south side from being directly overhead. He determined that 8 degrees was the equivalent of 500 miles (he used a different scale), so that 360 degrees (that in a circle as per Hipparchus) would be 360/8 x 500 = 45 x 500 = 22,500 miles, and thus the circumference of the earth.
