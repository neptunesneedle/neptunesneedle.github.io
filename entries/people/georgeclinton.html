yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Soldier, governor of New York, and vice president of the United States.

p2: His opposition to a strong federal government stemmed, in part, from the fact that] because of its fine harbor, New York had natural advantages in trade over other states in the union. Clinton feared that a federal government with the power to regulate commerce provided in the Constitution could be used to negate New York's commercial hegemony over neighboring states.
