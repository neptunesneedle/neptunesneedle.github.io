p1: Isabella of Castille, married Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469, thus uniting Spain's largest kingdoms and making possible the successful effort over the following two dcades to defeat the Moslems and drive them from the Iberian peninsula in 1492. That same year she and Ferdinand backed Columbus in his effort to reach China by sailing west. She also undertook to expel all Jews from Spain. Despite growing skepticism as to whether Columbus had reached Asia, and doubts about his abilities as a colonial administrator, she backed three more of his voyages.
