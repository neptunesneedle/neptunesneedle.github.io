yourname: Peter Richards

p1: His father, one of the first shipbuilders in New York... Part of the time he was established on the site of his father's old yards... ...during his partnership with Charles Browne, builder of the Clermont) he was farther uptown at Clinton and Cherry Sts. At that period of American history naval constructors did not make contracts to build vessels but were employed by the Government... "at the rate of $2,000 per annum." Under such an agreement Cheeman received the contract for the famous 44-gun frigate President, which was, however, built and launched in the yards of Christian Bergh... Prior to launching of the President in 1800 Cheesman had already built the Briganza and the Draper, each of 300 tons, and the Ontario of 500 tons. Later, during his partnership with Brownne, some of the finest vessels of the day came from his yards, such as the Silenus, the Triton, and the Illinois.
