yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Soldier, mariner and explorer, Samuel de Champlain was born in Brouage, on the Gulf of Saintonge, along the Biscay coast of France. His father and uncle were both mariners, and both served King Henry IV as naval officers. Champlain became accomplished sailor before attaching himself to court of Henry IV as court geographer, despite his limited formal education. Sailed with Spanish treasure fleet to Caribbean in 1599-1601. His report earns him a pension from King Henry IV. 

p2: His first voyage to North America occurred in 1603 to revive French claims based on Cartier's expeditions in 1534-42. Accompanied François Gravé Du Pont on a fur-trading venture up the St. Lawrence River to Tadoussac at the mouth of the Saguenay River. It was the customary summer rendezvous for European traders and the Montagnais Indians, who provided furs in exchange for metal goods, cloth, and trinkets. Sailed up the St. Lawrence to present site of Montreal. 

p3: Champlain learned of Lake Champlain to south of St. Lawrence, Hudson Bay at the northern end of the Saguenay River, and the Great Lakes. Thought he had happened upon water transit to the Pacific. 

p4: In 1604 Champlain explored the Maine coast (Norumbega) and Penobscot River; then as far south as Cape Cod. 

P5: He returned to New France several times thereafter, always trying to secure for France permanent settlements. His dealings with the native Indians were generally humane. He died of natural causes in Quebec on Christmas day, 1635. 

P6: In all, Champlain had between 1599 and 1635 made some 27 Atlantic crossings in 37 years.
