yourname: Peter Richards

p1: President of the Confederate States of America and U.S. senator.

p2: Davis was an attractive choice for president of the Confederate States once the dissolution of the Union became a reality. His stands for southern rights were well known, but he did not alarm the Upper South. Davis accepted his election by the Montgomery convention with reluctance, for he would have preferred to serve the South as a general in command of Mississippi's troops.

p3: Seeing that it was essential to control not only the South's manpower, but also its economy, Davis obtained through legislation extensive power over railroads and shipping. By these means he tried to ensure that foreign trade and the transportation system would serve the country's needs.
