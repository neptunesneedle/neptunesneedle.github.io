yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Polish-born astronomer and mathematician, first European since ancient times to argue that the erth rotated around the sun, rather than vice versa. His helio-centric views would not have been favorably received by the Church, which favored the earth-centered view of Aristotle, but because he did not try to publish his views during his lifetime, unlike his admirer Galileo later, he was not silenced.
