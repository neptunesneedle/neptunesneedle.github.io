p1: Lobsters are crustaceans that have a tough shell and live on the ocean floor. There are many different types of lobsters, including the Maine (or American) lobster (an aggressive lobster with large front claws), the spiny lobster, and crayfish. Lobsters are invertebrates, animals without a backbone. Lobsters are cold-blooded; their body temperature depends on the temperature of the water.
