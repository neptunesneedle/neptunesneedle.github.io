yourname: Peter Richards

p1: A mangrove is a woody plant or plant community which lives between the sea and the land in areas which are inundated by tides. Thus a mangrove is a species as well as a community of plants. It can be a tree but (like a rainforest plant) it can also be a shrub or palm. All share the ability to live in salt water.
