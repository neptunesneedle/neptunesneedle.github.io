p1: The Pioneer was built in 1885 in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania to carry sand from the mouth of the Delaware Bay to Chester, Pennsylvania. It was the first of two cargo sloops built of iron and the only one of them currently in existence; sloops were the favored rig for use in the Hudson. Since its christening, the Pioneer has functioned as a laborer and has been constantly modernized to keep up with the demands of commerce. In 1895, the Pioneer was re-rigged because the single large sail required too many people to manage. In order to keep down the cost of labor, the Pioneer became a two masted schooner. In 1930, the schooner was fitted with an engine. In 1966, a private investor bought the schooner to prevent it from being scrapped and rebuilt the hull with steel plating. After restoring the schooner, he used it to transport lumber as a part of his dock building business. The Pioneer is 102' in length, with a 65' deck length, and 58' 11'' length at waterline. It has an iron and steel hull and is a gaff-rigged schooner. Its rig height is 79' and it weighs 77 tons, which helps prevent it from capsizing in strong winds. Its aftermost mast is larger, giving the back of the schooner more power. Its four sails (the main, fore, stay, and jib) are center-lined, making the schooner more maneuverable and easier to turn in the wind.
