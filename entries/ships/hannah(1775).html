p1: George Washington hired the Hannah, a marbleead fishing schooner, upon his arrival in Masschusetts in July 1775, and assigned her to Capt. Nicholson Broughton, for coastal defense. Broughton did battle with the British sloop Unity in early September of 1775. A altercation with the HMS Nautilus later that month saw her run aground and nearly splinter apart. Thereafter she was taken out of service. Hannah was the first armed vessel fitted out in the service of the United States.
