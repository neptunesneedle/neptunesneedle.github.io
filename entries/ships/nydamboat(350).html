p1: Early instance of Northern European shipbuilding. Clinker-built (overlapping planks) with 5 strakes. Iron rivets; side-rudder; rowlocks made of forked branches attached to gunwales. Discovered in 1863 about 50 miles from Kiel, Germany. Still earlier clinker-style boats from Northern Europe were the Hjortspring boat (4th C BC) and the Bjorke boat from Sweden (AD 100). Nydam boat was a fast, seagoing rowing vessel used in the migration of Northern Europeans to Britain in 5th and 6th centuries.
