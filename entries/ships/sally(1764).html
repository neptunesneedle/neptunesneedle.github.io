p1: Brigantine. Used by Brown Brothers of Providence on a slave-procuring expedition to West Africa in 1764-65. Master of the vessel Esek Hopkins. Cargo outward consisted of spermacetti candles, tobacco, onions and 17,274 gallons of RI-distilled rum. These were to be traded for slaves procured on the African west coast, who were to be transported to the West Indies to be sold for sugar and molasses. The ship overstayed on the West African coast, had trouble filling its hold with slaves,who attempted a rebellion at sea. of the 196 Africans brought aboard, 106 failed to complete the "middle passage." The venture was a money-loser for the Browns.
