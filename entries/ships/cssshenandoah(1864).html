p1: Confederate raider that late in the Civil War captured and burned 38 ships in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Pacific, including a substantial portion of the New England whaling fleet in the Arctic Ocean more than two months after Lee's surrender. During its raids and in the subsequent flight from capture, the Shenandoah circumnavigated the globe.
