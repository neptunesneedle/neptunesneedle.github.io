p1: Schooner. Built in 1893 at Essex, Mass., the Lettie G. Howard is a type of gaff-rigged fishing schooner once widely used along the Atlantic seaboard. After an active life in the fisheries of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the schooner was sold to the South Street Seaport Museum in 1968 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1988. Between 1991 and 1993 the museum completely restored her to her original 1893 appearance and fitted her to accommodate trainees on educational cruises. In 1994, the Lettie was certified as a Sailing School Vessel by the U.S. Coast Guard.
