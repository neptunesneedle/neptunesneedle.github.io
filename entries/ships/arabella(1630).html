yourname: Peter Richards

p1: The Arbella, under the command of Captain Peter Milbourne, with 8 other ships, departed Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, March 29, 1630, and then spent nearly two weeks trying to emerge from the English Channel. It reached soundings (80 fathom) on June 3, sighted land off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, on June 6th, and arrived at Salem, Massachusetts, June 13. The route across the Atlantic was about as direct as it could be, sailing westward along the 52nd parallel when the contrary winds permitted.
