p1: Strait (17 mi/27 km long, c.1 mi/1.6 km wide), separating Eur. from Asiatic Turkey and joining the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara. A constant flow of water from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea gives the Bosporus the appearance of a river at its narrowest parts. Two bridges spanning the strait have been built in recent years. The Bosporus and Dardanelles, leading to the Mediterranean, have long been of great strategic importance. Istanbul (Constantinople) is on the Bosporus, which is lined with villas and old castles. On it is the narrow inlet, the Golden Horn, forming the harbor of Istanbul. The strait has been refortified by Turkey after the Montreux Convention of 1936.
