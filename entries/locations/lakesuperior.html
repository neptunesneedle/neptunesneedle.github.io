yourname: Peter Richards

p1: 350 miles long. 500 feet deep. 31,700 sq. miles surface area. Flows into Lake Huron. 

p2: The largest of the five Great Lakes. It is also the deepest and coldest of the five. Superior could contain all the other Great Lakes and three more Lake Eries. Because of its size, Superior has a retention time of 191 years. Retention time is a measure based on the volume of water in the lake and the mean rate of outflow. Most of the Superior basin is forested, with little agriculture because of a cool climate and poor soils. The forests and sparse population result in relatively few pollutants entering Lake Superior, except through airborne transport.
