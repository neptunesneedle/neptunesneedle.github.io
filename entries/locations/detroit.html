Detroit is a port of entry and a major Great Lakes shipping and RR center.

Three years later the British withstood a long siege there in Pontiac’s rebellion. Amer. control, resulting from Jay’s Treaty, was established in 1796. Detroit was 1st the territorial and then the state capital from 1805 to 1847. It assumed great importance after the mid-19th cent. as a shipping, shipbuilding, and mfg. center.
