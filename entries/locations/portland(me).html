In 1866 a great fire destroyed much of Portland. Seat of the Univ. of Southern Maine and Westbrook Col. Numerous museums. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (whose house is a landmark) and Robert E. Peary lived here. The old lighthouse at Cape Elizabeth nearby, est. 1791, is still in use. Settled c.1632, set off from Falmouth and inc. 1786.
