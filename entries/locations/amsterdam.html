yourname: Peter Richards

p1: City (1994 pop. 724,096), constitutional (cap.) and largest city of the Kingdom of the Neth., North Holland prov., W Neth., on the Het IJ, an inland harbor and inlet of Markermeer (S part of IJsselmeer); 52º22'N 04º54'E. Noordzee Canal extends 15 mi/24 km W to North Sea, giving harbor ocean access. Amsterdam-Rhine Canal, North Holland Canal, and other inland canals join Het IJ here; Amsterdam’s noted canal system, which circles the Centrum (city center), is fed by the Amstel R., which flows from S. The city is cut by about 40 concentric and radial canals that are flanked by streets and crossed by 400 bridges. Because of the canals, the city is called the “Venice of the North.” Among Europe’s leading ports, Amsterdam is also one of the great commercial, intellectual, and artistic cities of Europe.
