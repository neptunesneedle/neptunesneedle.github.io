yourname: Peter Richards
p1: [32N/65W] British crown colony (21 sq miles; 1991 pop. 58,460), comprising some 150 coral rocks, islets, and isls. (of which some 20 are inhabited), in the Atlantic Ocean, c.570 miles SE of Cape Hatteras, N.C.; (cap.). Reputedly the 1st person to set foot here was the Span. navigator Juan de Bermudez (1503-1511), but they remained uninhabited, despite visits by Spaniards and Englishmen, until Sir George Somers and a group of colonists on their way to Va. were shipwrecked here in 1609. This incident was known to Shakespeare when he wrote The Tempest.

p2: Long called Somers Isls., the Bermudas were 1st governed by chartered companies but were acquired by the crown in 1684. The harbor of St. George was a base for privateers during the War of 1812, and the isl. was a center for Confederate blockade runners during the Amer. Civil War. The U.S., under a 99-year lease, operates a naval and air force base. Four foreign-held military bases used to track Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic were closed in the mid-1990s and returned to the govt. of Bermuda. Southside, the former U.S. Naval air station adjoining Bermuda’s airport, is to be developed as a port, relocating Hamilton’s container terminal.
