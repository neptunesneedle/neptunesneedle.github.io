p1: Tropical sea (area; c.970,000 sq miles), arm of the Atlantic Ocean, Central America; 15º00'N 75º00'W. It is bordered on the N and E by the West Indies archipelago, on the S by S. Amer., and on the W by the Central Amer. isthmus. The Caribbean is linked to the Gulf of Mexico by the Yucatan Channel; to the Atlantic by many straits, of which the Windward Channel and Mona Passage are the most important; and to the Pacific Ocean by the Panama Canal. The Magdalena is the largest river entering the sea; L. Maracaibo is its largest embayment. Geologically, the Caribbean Sea consists of 2 main basins separated by a broad, submarine plateau. Cayman Trench, a trench bet. Cuba and Jamaica, contains the Caribbean’s deepest point (24,721 ft below sea level). The Caribbean’s water is clear, warm (75ºF/24ºC), and less salty than the Atlantic; the basin has a very low tidal range (c.1 ft/0.3 m). The Caribbean Sea has a counterclockwise current; water enters through the Lesser Antilles, is warmed, and exits via the Yucatan Channel, where it forms the Gulf Stream. Volcanic activity and earthquakes are common in the Caribbean, as are destructive hurricanes that originate over the sea or in the Atlantic. After the Caribbean was visited by Christopher Columbus in 1493, Spain claimed the area, and its ships searched for treasure. With the Span. discovery of the Pacific Ocean in 1513 the Caribbean became the main route of their expeditions and, later, of convoys. Pirates and warships of rival powers preyed on Span. ships in the Caribbean. Although Spain controlled most of the sea, Britain, France, Holland, and Denmark established colonies on the isles along the E fringe. The 1800s brought U.S. ships into the Caribbean, especially after 1848, when many gold-seekers crossed the sea to reach Calif. via Panama. After unsuccessful French attempt in the late 19th century to build a canal across Panama, the U.S., in 1903, assumed control of the project. The 1914 opening of the Panama Canal paved the way for increased U.S. interest and involvement in this strategic sea, sometimes called the “American Mediterranean.” Several Caribbean isles have U.S. military bases, many of which were established during World War II as support bases to protect the Panama Canal. The naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba (est. 1899) is the oldest U.S. Caribbean base. U.S. policy since the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 has been to exclude foreign powers from the Caribbean; however, in 1959, Cuba became the first country to come under strong foreign (Soviet) influence. U.S. intervention in the affairs of Caribbean countries, such as the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the landing of U.S. marines at Santo Domingo in 1965 and at Grenada in 1983, and the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1990, reflects the region’s importance in U.S. eyes. This influence has disappeared with Soviet collapse and breakup of USSR. U.S. military bases are limited to Roosevelt Roads in P.R., Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the Panama Canal. Petroleum, iron ore, bauxite, sugar, coffee, and bananas are the main local products moved on the sea. Economically, the region is dependent on U.S. and Eur. patronage and a large tourism industry. The Caribbean Sea has also acted as a barrier, isolating the isles and preventing the mingling of peoples on the scale characteristic of Latin America. In the 1990s, however, the increased need for labor due to the growth of tourism attracted immigrants to some of the isles in the sea.
