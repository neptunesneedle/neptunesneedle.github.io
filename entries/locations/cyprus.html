p1: Republic (3,591 sq. miles; 1994 est. pop. 890,208), an isl. in the E Mediterranean Sea, (cap.) Nicosia. Located c.40 miles S of Turkey and c.60 miles W of Syria. Excavations have proved the existence of a Neolithic culture on Cyprus in the period from 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C. Phoenicians settled on the isl. c.800 B.C. Cyprus subsequently fell under Assyrian, Egyptian, Pers., Roman, and Br. rule. In 1489, Cyprus was annexed by Venice, and the Turks conquered it in 1571. In 1814 the isl. was annexed again, this time by Britain.
