yourname: Peter Richards

p1: Large estuary of Atlantic Ocean, NE N.C., c.55 miles long, 3 - 14 miles wide. Shallow and tideless, the sound is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks sand barrier, branched through Oregeon Inlet from Pamlico Sound to SE. The Chowan River (from N) and Roanoke River (from W) are the main streams and enter the head of the sound. Intracoastal Waterway crosses Albermarle Sound near its mouth, from Alligator River to Currituck Sound. Dismal Swamp Canal connects it with Chesapeake Bay to north. Edenton was the region's principal port in colonial era.
