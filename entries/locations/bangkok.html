p1: City (1990 pop. 8,538,610), (cap.) Thailand and Bangkok prov., SW Thailand, on both E and W banks of the Chao Phraya R., near the Gulf of Thailand; 13º44'N 100º30'E. Thailand’s largest city and one of the leading cities of Southeast Asia, Bangkok lies in the heart of the country’s major commercial rice-growing region. Bangkok is comprised of Bangkok proper; the industrial city of Thon Buri on the W bank of the river; and Klongtoi Wharf, c.5 mi/8 km downstream, which, along with Bangkok’s man-made harbor, handles the bulk of Thailand’s foreign trade. During World War II, the city was occupied by the Japanese and was a target of Allied bombing raids.
