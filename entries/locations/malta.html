p1: Malta (MAWL-tah), ancient Melita, republic (122 sq mi/316 sq km; 1994 estimated population 369,451; 2004 estimated population 396,851), in the Mediterranean Sea, S of Sicily; (cap.) Valletta; 35º55'N 14º26'E. Geography The country consists of Malta (95 sq mi/246 sq km), Gozo (26 sq mi/67 sq km), and Comino (one sq mi/2.6 sq km) islands, and uninhabited islets of Comminotto, Fungus Rock, Filfla and Saint Paul’s islands. The group is sometimes called the Maltese Islands. Malta has no rivers or lakes, no natural resources, and very few trees. Nevertheless it is of great strategic value and was an important British military base until 1979. Malta believed by some to be the island St. Paul washed up on following his shipwreck in 60 AD.
