p1: City ( 2000 pop. 147,306), (cap.) Onondaga co., central N.Y., on Onondaga L. and the Barge Canal; 43º02'N 76º08'W. A port of entry, its mfg. includes air conditioners, electrical and electronic equip., motor vehicle and aircraft parts, chinaware, shoes, machinery, and pharmaceuticals. Salt springs were discovered in what is now Syracuse in 1654. Saltmaking, the city’s chief industry from its settlement until after the Civil War, declined due to competition. However, its favorable location on the Erie Canal (opened here in 1819) and on RR stimulated industrial development. Recreational lakes and streams are abundant in the area. Settled c.1788, inc. as a city 1848.
