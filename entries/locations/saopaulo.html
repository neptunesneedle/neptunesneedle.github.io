In 1681, Sao Paulo was made the administrative capital of the surrounding area, and in 1711 it achieved city status. The independence movement was strong in the city; in 1822 at Sao Paulo, Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro I proclaimed the country independent of Portugal. The city, however, remained a minor commercial center until the 1880s, when widespread coffee cultivation in Sao Paulo state brought sudden growth, prosperity, and an influx of Eur. immigrants.
