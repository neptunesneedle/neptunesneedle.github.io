p1: City (1995 pop. 482,555), (cap.) Norway, and of Oslo co. (area; 175 sq mi/454 sq km), also (cap.) the co. govt. of Akershus co., which physically surrounds Oslo on 3 sides, SE Norway, at the head of the Oslofjorden (a deep inlet of the Skagerrak); 59º56'N 10º45'E. Oslo is Norway’s largest city, its main port, and its chief commercial, industrial, communication, and transportation center. Mfg. (food, textiles, forest prods., machines). It has a significant electrotechnical, graphics, and printing industry. Founded c.1050 by Harald III, Oslo became (1299) the natl. capital. In the 14th cent. it came under the dominance of the Hanseatic League. After a great fire (1624), the city was rebuilt by Christian IV and was renamed Christiania (or Kristiania); in 1925 the name Oslo again became official. The city’s modern growth dates from the late 19th cent., when it also replaced Bergen as the main city in Norway. In World War II, Oslo fell (April 9, 1940) to the Germans, and it was occupied until the surrender (May 8, 1945) of the Ger. forces in Norway. The neighboring industrial commune of Aker was inc. into Oslo in 1948. Today, Oslo is a modern city in design and construction, and its govt. has fostered contemporary art in a number of impressive public projects. Among these are the 150 sculptural groups by Gustav Vigeland in the famous Frogner Park. Oslo’s major suburbs are Barum and Asker to the W, and Oppegard and Lerenskog to the S and SE. The city’s chief public bldgs. include the royal palace (1848), the Storting (parliament), and the city hall (1950), which was decorated by many Nor. artists. Surviving medieval structures include the Akers kirke (12th cent.) and the Akershus fortress (13th cent.), and there are ruins of the Cathedral of St. Hallvard, the 1st cathedral of Oslo. The Univ. of Oslo (founded 1811), the natl. theater (1899), the natl. gallery, the Nobel Inst., and a col. of architecture are among the city’s cultural institutions. In addition, the Folk Mus. has reconstructions of old Nor. timber houses and of a 12th-cent. stave church, and the Kon-Tiki Mus. has mementos of Thor Heyerdahl’s trip (1947) across the Pacific Ocean. The forested hills surrounding Oslo are popular excursion points; the annual Holmenkollen ski meet nearby attracts an internatl. group of skiers. The 1952 Olympic winter games were held at Oslo. A new internatl. airport is scheduled to open at Gadermoen, 45 mi/73 km to the N, in 1998, with a high-speed RR link to Oslo.
