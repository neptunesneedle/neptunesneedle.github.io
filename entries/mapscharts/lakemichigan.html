yourname: Peter Richards

p1: 307 miles long. 22,300 sq. miles of surface area. Illinois River to the south; to Lake Huron to NE.


p2: Lake Michigan, the second largest Great Lake by volume with just under 1,180 cubic miles of water, and third largest by surface (after Suerior and Huron), and is the only Great Lake entirely within the United States. Lake Michigan has more than 1,600 miles of shoreline. The lake reaches 925 feet at its deepest point. The lake's northern tier is in the colder, less developed upper Great Lakes region, while its more temperate southern basin contains the Milwaukee and Chicago metropolitan areas. The drainage basin, approximately twice as large as the 22,300 square miles of surface water, includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Lake Michigan is hydrologically inseparable from Lake Huron, joined by the wide Straits of Mackinac.
