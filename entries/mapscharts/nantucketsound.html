Part of the Nantucket Shelf Region, it shares the continental shelf with the Gulf of Maine region to the north and the Middle Atlantic region to the south. It is along the North Atlantic Flyaway, serving as a fereding and breeding ground to many species of birds, including the federally protected piping plover. It is also a breeding ground for gray seals.
