p1: The New York Bight is a large gulf/arc on the Atlantic Ocean along the coast of North America in the northeastern United States. It is formed by the coastal identation between the New Jersey and Long Island around the mouth of the Hudson River at New York Harbor.

p2: The sea floor of the bight consists largely of continental shelf and includes the Hudson Canyon, an undersea Pleistocene submarine canyon, probably from the extension of the Hudson River during the ice ages, when the sea level was lower.

p3: The bight includes major shipping channels that access New York Harbor. The coastal climate of the gulf is temperate as the result of direct contact from the Gulf Stream along the coast of North America. The Jersey Shore and the coast of Long Island are popular summer recreational spots for the region.
