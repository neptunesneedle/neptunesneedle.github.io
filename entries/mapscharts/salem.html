yourname: Peter Richards

p1: City (1990 pop. 38,091; 2000 pop. 40,407), (cap.) Essex co., NE Mass., on an inlet of Massachusetts Bay; 42º32'N 70º52'W. Its once famous harbor has silted up. Salem has electronic, leather, and machinery industries, and tourists are drawn to its many historical landmarks.

p2: In 1626, Roger Conant led a group from Cape Ann to this site, called Naumkeag by the Native Americans. Salem’s early history was darkened by the witchcraft trials of 1692, in which Samuel Sewall was a judge. From colonial days through the clipper ship era, Salem was world famous as a port and a wealthy center for the China trade. It was a privateering base in the Amer. Revolution and in the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hawthorne was overseer of the port from 1846 to 1849.

p3: Shipping declined after the War of 1812, and the city turned to manufacturing. The Peabody-Essex Institute. (est. 1848) has an excellent library and historical collections.
