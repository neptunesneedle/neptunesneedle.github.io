yourname: Peter Richards

p1: City (1990 pop. 269,063; 2000 pop. 256,231), (cap.) Jefferson co., N Ky., on the Ohio R., at the Falls of the Ohio, opposite Jeffersonville and New Albany (Ind.); 38º13'N 85º44'W. Commonly referred to as Falls City and “gateway to the South.” It is the largest city in Ky., a major river port, and one of the important industrial, financial, marketing, and shipping centers for the South and Midwest. Louisville developed at the falls, as a portaging place (a canal was built in 1830; the McAlpine Locks currently allow modern barge traffic to pass the falls). After the arrival of the RRs in the mid-19th cent., its role as a shipping center became even more important. During the Civil War it was a center of pro-Union activity in the state and a military and supply base for Federal forces.
